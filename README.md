## ðŸ“Œ Question 3  

### ðŸ”¹ Event Bubbling and How It Works

**Event Bubbling:**  
Event Bubbling is a way of **event propagation** in the DOM where an event starts at the **target element** and then **bubbles up** to its parent elements one by one until it reaches the `document`.

**How It Works:**  
- When we click on a **child button**, it triggers the event on the button first and shows its own inner text.  
- Then the event **bubbles up** to the parent element and triggers the parentâ€™s event.  
- After that, it continues to the grandparent element and so on.  
- The bubbling stops when the event reaches the `document`.
